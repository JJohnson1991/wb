The client does not know what the server is
it knows that it can request data from it.

first it makes a [[DNS query]] to find the IP address of the website. 

Then an [[HTTP request]](way to send information to the server) is sent to that address

Server Listen for request on certain ports.
Server sees the requests and understand the requests, it then send HTML, CSS & JS 

Your browsers than renders that on the webpage!.

>Any Machine that has an IP Address has 16,000 ports that programs on the machine can listen to!

You must specify the port you want to communicate on!

HTTP port 80
